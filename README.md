# PixelPaint

### What is this?
A pixel art editor created using the Java.swing associated libraries. Allows for the saving of images you create and includes a basic click tool for a single grid space and a paint tool. Also allows for enabling and disabling the grids.

 ### Why make this project?
 I was looking to expand the already existing code from my snake project as I felt there was a lot of potential with the gridded area and colouring of each block. I decided to pivot this existing code into the pixel art editor you see before you. It was a test of problem solving especially when it came to the bucket tool but I feel it was a great example of my programming skills.

### How to build the project
To my knowledge simply forking the repository and running the main "Paint" class should run the application as intended.

### Where could I improve?
* Paint Bucket: It is error prone and does not function correctly 100% of the time. It was the source of many frustrations during the development process and I believe it could be a lot better than it is. If I was to dedicate more time to this project I would want to fix this tool so it works flawlessly, but its current state will do for the sake of showcasing my skills.
